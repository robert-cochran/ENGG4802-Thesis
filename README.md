# Engineering Thesis
My final year thesis involved adding to the Calpy system which aimed to detect and measure pause usage in speech for the purpose of online alzheimers detection. The process involved using Shannon Entropy to measure the amount of information content delivered while someone is speaking and set thresholds when the information content (or novelty) began to drop, indicating a potential atypical speech pattern. This could later be used by a medical professional to aid in diagnosis or treatment.
